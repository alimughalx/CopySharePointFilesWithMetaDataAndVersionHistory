Copy a file library from source to destination library with meta data info of document with complete version history of file.

This script will work for SharePoint On-Premises and SharePoint Online.
Just change the $WebURL with your domain / server URL. Change Source and Target Library Names according to your desired internal library names.
$WebURL="http://your-domain.com/"
$SourceLibrary ="SourceLibrary"
$TargetLibrary = "DestinationLibrary"

Hope this can help you.
